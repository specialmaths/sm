        des: "Special Maths Academy Limited (SMAL) welcomes you to the Summer Camp where cool kids from all over the country gather to share their passion for mathematics. The students will get to rub minds, work on problem sets, and network with the most brilliant minds from all over Nigeria and abroad during the camp. The students representing Nigeria at International Mathematics Olympiad and Pan-African Mathematics Olympiad will be attending the summer camp. Your wards will get the opportunity to interact with them through our classrooms and online seminars organized during the camp. This camp is designed to teach olympiad-level mathematics as well as instill other important skill sets that determine the success of a student; these include but are not limited to positive mindset, study strategy/tools, perseverance. We do this in order to maximize the learning outcome of our students. The participants leave our camps more inspired than they came in and we mentor them to take the strategies learned during the program and apply in other areas of their lives. Thus, creating a champion mindset out of each student.",
        instructorNote: "Our tried and true system is based on 24 years of cumulative experience shared between our team of instructors, who themselves are some of the most successful participants from Nigeria at IMO/PAMO achieving Gold, Silver and Bronze medals. We pride ourselves in setting up our students for success in Mathematical contests and are sure your wards will leave our sessions more prepared than without our teaching/mentor-ship.",
        categories: "The camp program will be in two categories, namely: Pre-Olympiad and Intermediate Olympiad. After the student has registered, he/she will receive a confirmation email together with other details on how to enroll in the online classroom. All new students will be required to take a sample test to determine their appropriate level. This will be provided as part of the email they will be receiving upon registration and confirmation of payment. However, all the students who have participated in any of our previous camps will be placed automatically in their respective classes appropriate to their performances.",
        beginEndDate: "The camp is set to commence on 3rd of August, 2020 and would last for 4 weeks with additional one free-week for exams, seminars and closing ceremony. The camp is expected to end on 5th September, 2020. The opening ceremony for the camp will be held on 3rd of August, 2020 at 4:00pm on Zoom. More details will be provided through the emails each participant will receive upon completing the registration.",
        payment: "The registration fee per student/participant is N15,000 (including 7.5% VAT) only. With this fee, the participant would have access to all the course materials and live session videos of the camp. Students who got some form of scholarship during our previous camp should contact us before their registration to be advised on how to pay. The deadline for making payments and completing your registration is on Saturday 1st, August, 2020 at 23:59:00.",
        testimonials: "See what our students, parents and teachers are saying about us. This could be your story too.",
        contact: "For enquiry, reach us on mobile at +2348166444005 or +2347057598887; you can also send us an email at contact@specialmaths.ng; social media pages at Facebook (Special Maths Academy), Twitter (@SpecialMaths).",
        commitments: "This is a four-week engaging program. A classroom in Piazza will be created for the camp where all students can interact with the instructors and among them- selves on the topics learned in class. The training involves an in-class live (zoom) sessions of 90 minutes daily (between 4:00pm - 5:30pm) from Monday to Thursday. There will be 24/7 online support in the classroom to further help answer students' questions. After each class, the students will be provided a problem set to work on that will prepare them for the weekend exams. There will be 2 exams, with a 2 weeks interval between the exams. These exams will be administered on Saturday through Sunday. Students are to submit all homeworks and exams to the course instructor by taking a clear scan of their works (“cam scanner” from google playstore is advised). Information on how to submit the exams will be provided in the classroom during the camp. The student should purchase a sufficient data package, download zoom program (https://zoom.us/download) before the camp begins. At the end of the program, an electronic Gold, Silver and Bronze, Honorable Mention, Special prize and Participation Certificates will be awarded which will be determined by the cumulative scores of all the weekend exams written during the camp. In addition, the top 3 students in the camp will be awarded some cash prizes: First position- N30,000 Second position- N25,000 Third position- N22,000 These students will be selected based on a number of factors and not only by their grades. This is to encourage our students to take the process seriously and put up their best self during the camp.",
