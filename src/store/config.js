      longDescription: "Special Maths Academy​ (SMA)​ ​was founded​ with ​the aim of training intelligent ​young minds to be competitive at the level of the world’s t​oughest Maths contest (IMO). At ​SMA, we are passionate about developing the next generation of mathematicians that will solve the world's most challenging problems. Our tried and true system is based on 24 years of cumulative experience shared between our team of instructors, who themselves are some of the most successful participants from Nigeria at IMO/PAMO achieving Gold, Silver and Bronze medals. We pride ourselves in setting up our students for success in Mathematical contests and are sure that the Nigerian IMO/PAMO team will leave our sessions more prepared than they have been before taking our intensive online training.",
      longMission: "Our mission is to build a sustainable ecosystem for the most talented Nigerian mathematicians; to mentor and nurture them from an early stage and become ready to participate in IMO/PAMO by the time they get to JSS3. Our aim is to build an army of IMO level problem solvers that can consistently obtain GOLD and SILVER medals thereby creating difficulty in selecting Nigerian teams for the various international competitions.",
