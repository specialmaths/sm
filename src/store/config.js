      longDescription: "This camp is specifically designed for high-performing students who have participated or interested in participating and acing the national olympiads. Our philosophy is that students will develop stronger problem solving abilities through intuitive understandng of theorems and concepts as opposed to memorizing formulas to solve problems through repeated drills. Thus, our trainings are structured to reflect this philosophy..",
